                                At CHRONOS, we believe that luxury and responsibility are not
                                mutually exclusive. A timepiece designed to last generations is
                                inherently a sustainable product — and we take that philosophy
                                further at every step of our process.
                            </p>

                                From sourcing raw materials to the final polish, every decision
                                is guided by our commitment to minimize environmental impact while
                                maximizing the beauty and longevity of our creations.

                                Our Geneva atelier has been carbon-neutral since 2020, powered
                                entirely by renewable energy. We've reduced our water usage by
                                60% through closed-loop recycling systems and eliminated single-use
                                plastics across our entire supply chain.

                                By 2030, we aim to achieve net-zero emissions across our entire
                                value chain, setting a new standard for the luxury watch industry.
