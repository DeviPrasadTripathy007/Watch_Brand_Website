                                CHRONOS was born in September 2025 in a small Indian workshop, where master
                                horologist Aditya crafted his first timepiece — a pocket watch
                                of extraordinary precision that won the Geneva Observatory Prize.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What began as one man's obsession with perfection evolved into a
                                dynasty of watchmaking excellence. Aditya's philosophy was simple yet
                                radical: every component, no matter how small, deserved the same
                                meticulous attention to detail. By late September two very ambitious and visionary friends
                                Devi and Digdarshan decided to join more company that would change the way people think about watches.

                                By the late 2025, CHRONOS had established itself as one of
                                the premier watchmakers in Silicon University Sec-D. The brand's commitment to
                                hand-finished movements and innovative complications attracted
                                collectors and connoisseurs from around the world.
